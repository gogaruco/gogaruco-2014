    session_details: "The increasing accessibility of computing and scripting languages means more and more of us don’t have computer science fundamentals and hand-wave our laptops and servers as &#8220;magic&#8221;. But, it doesn’t take much to learn that the wizard box you type on every day is just layers of simple logic wrapped and reused all the way up. Indeed, starting with a single nand gate you can build the entire realm of boolean logic, and from that, a computer. <p>Working through a curriculum called &#8220;Nand to Tetris&#8221; and it’s associated text book &#8220;The Elements of Computing Systems&#8221;, the Seattle.rb Study Group did exactly that. In just 12 short weeks,we went from nothing to a whole stack computer starting from just a single nand gate. We built a (simulated) computer, an assembler for its machine code, a virtual machine, a high level language compiler, and an OS with games to run. <p>In this talk, I will start with the nand gate, and build up a working computer explaining each layer as I go. You may not be able to build along with me in just a half hour, but I hope to infect you with my love for this curriculum and hopefully have it spread to your ruby/study group."

How often do you use it? Is it really worth keeping it around? Do you know what questions it can answer?<br /><br />In this talk I'll discuss how to use data to drive improvement and when to let it go. I'll focus not only on analysis tools, but also on interpretting data and how to decide if your data is valuable or clutter."

Rather than quick fixes, it's important to seek a deeper understanding of what went wrong.<p>Biologists, chemists, and physicists increase understanding about the world by applying the logical steps of the scientific method to discover solutions to complex problems. Like scientists, developers can learn troubleshooting skills by treating each problem like a mini science experiment.<p>In this talk we'll explore how using the scientific method can lead to greater understanding and more viable solutions to complex problems."

This messiness, however, doesn't mesh well with the general tendencies of software developers, who like to try to simplify the world with assumptions. When those assumptions later turn out to be wrong, bad things happen.<br /><br />In this talk, we'll discuss three perennial sources of bad developer assumptions: floating point numbers, dates and times and  the names of people, places, and things.<br /><br />We'll illustrate why each of several commonly-made assumptions is incorrect, show how to use Ruby to arrive at the correct answer, and empower you to make better decisions about your code in the process."

    session_details: "Monads are in danger of becoming a bit of a joke: for every person who raves about them, there's another person asking what in the world they are, and a third person writing a confusing tutorial about them. With their technical-sounding name and forbidding reputation, monads can seem like a complex, abstract idea that's only relevant to mathematicians and Haskell programmers.<br /><br />Forget all that! In this pragmatic talk we'll roll up our sleeves and get stuck into refactoring some awkward Ruby code, using the good parts of monads to tackle the problems we encounter along the way. We'll see how the straightforward design pattern underlying monads can help us to make our code simpler, clearer and more reusable by uncovering its hidden structure, and we'll all leave with a shared understanding of what monads actually are and why people won't shut up about them."
