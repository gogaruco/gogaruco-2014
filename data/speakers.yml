    session: "The Scientific Method of Troubleshooting"
    # sessiondetails: "For software engineers, troubleshooting is one of the toughest and most important skills to develop. When problems arise, a beginning developer's first instincts are to panic and head to StackOverflow. Rather than quick fixes, it's important to seek a deeper understanding of what went wrong.<p>Biologists, chemists, and physicists increase understanding about the world by applying the logical steps of the scientific method to discover solutions to complex problems. Like scientists, developers can learn troubleshooting skills by treating each problem like a mini science experiment.<p>In this talk we'll explore how using the scientific method can lead to greater understanding and more viable solutions to complex problems."

    session: "Let's Build a Computer!"
    # sessiondetails: "The increasing accessibility of computing and scripting languages means more and more of us don’t have computer science fundamentals and hand-wave our laptops and servers as “magic”. But, it doesn’t take much to learn that the wizard box you type on every day is just layers of simple logic wrapped and reused all the way up. Indeed, starting with a single nand gate you can build the entire realm of boolean logic, and from that, a computer. <p>Working through a curriculum called “Nand to Tetris” and it’s associated text book “The Elements of Computing Systems”, the Seattle.rb Study Group did exactly that. In just 12 short weeks,we went from nothing to a whole stack computer starting from just a single nand gate. We built a (simulated) computer, an assembler for its machine code, a virtual machine, a high level language compiler, and an OS with games to run. <p>In this talk, I will start with the nand gate, and build up a working computer explaining each layer as I go. You may not be able to build along with me in just a half hour, but I hope to infect you with my love for this curriculum and hopefully have it spread to your ruby/study group."

    session: "Reimplementing Ruby's Hash"
    # sessiondetails: "Hashes are very useful for labeling little bits of data. But do you know how cool they really are? For instance, whether a hash has 10 keys or 10 million doesn't change how long it takes to find the key you're looking for.<p>How does that work? I'll show you! We'll build our own hash class in Ruby. I'll also show you that "Big O" analysis isn't scary as we make our hash lean and mean. <p> Finally, we'll see what our hash can teach us about related topics, like programming languages and databases. Come ready to learn!"
