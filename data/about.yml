    bio: "<p>Josh likes to say that Ruby is the love child of Lisp and Smalltalk, raised by Perl the eccentric nanny.

He has spoken at RailsConf, regional conferences and meetups.</p><p>In past lives he's done Smalltalk VM implementation, spent too much time at Apple building the ill-fated OpenDoc, and helped design the Java VM that runs on the SIM card in your iPhone.
